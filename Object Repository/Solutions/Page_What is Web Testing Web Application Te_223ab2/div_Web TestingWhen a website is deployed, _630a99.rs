      <value>Web TestingWhen a website is deployed, anything can happen: broken links, difficult navigation, web security, and many other potential risks. A careful testing process is key to reducing these risks and maintaining web quality.Get startedView a demoClick to explore Katalon web testing in action →What is web testing?Web testing best techniquesWeb testing best practicesKatalon for web testingWhat is  web application testing?A web application (app) is a program delivered through the internet in the form of a browser interface. The purpose of a web app is efficiently communicating and exchanging information with its users while being compliant with a variety of browsers and operating systems (OSs).Web app testing, or web testing, is a software testing practice that helps ensure the quality and functionalities of the app according to the requirements. Web testing must detect all underlying issues, such as functional discrepancies, security breaches, integration problems, environmental issues, or traffic stress before it is delivered.Web Application Testing TechniquesWeb App Functionality TestingOne of the most common tests for web apps. Functionality testing checks if the initial build works as per its design. It often covers link testing, form validation, cookie testing, HTML and CSS validation, and database connection checkup.Web App Interface TestingInterface testing examines how the web interface responds to emulated interruptions, as well as its compatibility and interaction between different servers. Three key areas to focus on are the application server, web server, and database server.Web App Compatibility TestingCompatibility testing checks whether or not the web design is compatible with a variety of browsers and devices. This includes browser and OS compatibility testing, along with mobile browsing and printing options testing.Web App Performance TestingPerformance testing is load testing for web apps. Besides the tests on traffic load, stress tests and scalability tests are also crucial to the web performance, especially when it is potentially released to a large audience.How to Effectively Test a Website ApplicationRigorously carry out cross-browser compatibility testing.Define and select key parameters for usability tests.Execute performance tests under various conditions.Apply tests to all elements, third-party, and extensions of the web app.Ensure load tests are incrementally performed.Incorporate exploratory testing into the software development lifecycle.Keep URL strings unalterable in security tests.Involve the development team throughout the testing process.Test your app nowWhy Katalon for Web Application TestingSelenium compliantFully inherit Selenium capabilities. Bundled as a simple and robust continuous testing solution.Unique wait-time control solutionWait until the web app is completely loaded by the under engine. No timing code needed.Accurate object spyingEfficiently locate, detect, and store test objects to speed up your scripting process.Powerful recording utilityEffortlessly generate tests. Automatically store all UI elements to maximize reusability.Built-in and custom keywordsQuick to start with a rich set of built-in keywords. Robust to extend with custom keywords.Smart XPath for auto-healingAI-powered XPath location mechanism.
